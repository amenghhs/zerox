## Zerox OCR

A dead simple way of OCR-ing a document for AI ingestion. Documents are meant to be a visual representation after all. With weird layouts, tables, charts, etc. The vision models just make sense!

The general logic:

- Pass in a file (pdf, docx, image, etc.)
- Convert that file into a series of images
- Pass each image to GPT and ask nicely for Markdown
- Aggregate the responses and return Markdown
